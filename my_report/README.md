# Introduction
Hi, here I'm planning to make a short animation for the Digital-Storytelling lesson at my university.

# 1st Deliverable
This is the 1st deliverable. Nothing special so far, just followed the tutorials, made a few customizations and added some animated cameras to create the dailys you will find in the folders.
I tried to make a cool shot of the taxi for the last challenge.

I might change the subject later and make an animation for my video-game String-Drive.
