# Introduction
Hi, here I'm planning to make a short animation for the Digital-Storytelling lesson at my university.
The subject is probably going to be a car chase.

# 1st Deliverable
This is the 1st deliverable. Nothing special so far, just followed the tutorials, made a few customizations and added some animated cameras to create the dailys you will find in the folders.

For Unit 2 I created these simple custom buildings with "ProBuilder" in Unity:

For Unit 3, this is the traffic cone I modeled:

And for Unit 4, there are two dailies you can check. One is this one, with pedestrians.

And then the other one is this one where I tried to make a cool shot of the taxi for the last challenge.

The camera and car animation especially required a lot of work so that they came out smooth, with extra attention paid to the angle of the tangents on each keyframe.
